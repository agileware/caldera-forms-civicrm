# Caldera Forms CiviCRM

A WordPress plugin that integrates the [Caldera Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/caldera-forms/ "Caldera Forms WordPress plugin") plugin with [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/ "Open Source CRM").

The Caldera Forms CiviCRM plugin contains a set of form processors that interact with CiviCRM's API to retrieve, create and update data in CiviCRM. With this plugin, you can create responsive forms that expose CiviCRM fields and entities like Activities, Relationships, Tags, Groups and more.
